    "1. chapter 6.1-6.3, 7.1-7.7, 7.10 of Taylor \n",

    "\n",
    "1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homeworks are available ten days before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I (we) hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a scanned document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-4. Alternatively, you can hand in everything (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 5-6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L."
